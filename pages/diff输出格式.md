		  The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;
		  The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
		  The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
		  The Named is the mother of all things.
		  Therefore let there always be non-being,
		    so we may see their subtlety,
		  And let there always be being,
		    so we may see their outcome.
		  The two are the same,
		  But after they are produced,
		    they have different names.
